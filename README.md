# Project-Nova 🤖

## Introduction

Many gig economy workers, despite having consistent income, are "**credit invisible**." They lack the formal credit histories required by traditional financial institutions, creating a significant barrier to accessing loans for business investments or personal emergencies. This lack of access limits their economic mobility and potential for growth.

**Project-Nova** directly addresses this challenge by demonstrating how to build a **fairer, more inclusive credit scoring model** for these individuals. Instead of relying on traditional credit data, this project shows how to use alternative data while actively identifying and mitigating biases based on factors like gender and location. The goal is to create a model that is not only predictive but also equitable. ⚖️

This notebook walks through the following key steps:
1.  **Simulating Real-World Data:** A synthetic dataset is created to mirror the financial activities of gig economy workers, intentionally including biases to replicate real-world challenges.
2.  **Detecting and Analyzing Bias:** We use statistical methods to identify and understand the extent of biases within the dataset.
3.  **Training a Baseline Model:** A predictive model is trained on the original, biased data to establish a baseline for performance.
4.  **Applying Fairness Algorithms:** A mitigation technique is applied to the model's predictions to ensure equitable outcomes across different demographic groups.
5.  **Evaluating the Impact:** The effect of the bias mitigation is analyzed and visualized to confirm the model is both accurate and fair.

## ✨ Features

-   **Synthetic Data Generation:** Generates a custom dataset with controllable biases.
-   **Bias Verification:** Provides statistical verification of the introduced biases.
-   **Creditworthiness Prediction:** Trains a model to predict whether a partner is creditworthy.
-   **Bias Mitigation:** Implements a post-processing technique to mitigate bias in the model's predictions.
-   **Impact Visualization:** Visualizes the impact of the mitigation process, showing how many partners' classifications were changed to achieve fairness.

## 📊 Results

The notebook generates several outputs, including:

-   A biased dataset saved as `nova_custom_biased_dataset.csv`.
-   Verification of biases in the dataset, showing disparities in earnings and GMV based on gender and location.
-   A visualization of the impact of bias mitigation in the form of a movement matrix, which shows how many partners were upgraded or downgraded to ensure fairness.

Here is an example of the mitigation impact matrix generated by the notebook:

This matrix clearly shows how many partners were moved from "Not Creditworthy" to "Creditworthy" and vice-versa after applying the bias mitigation technique.
